title: "Rheinmetall Barzan Advanced Technologies - Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) R&D"
excerpt: "Providing a robust command and control (C2) software for a fleet of UGVs. My contribution over the course of three years is divided into three main categories: autonomous features, embedded software features, and system integration. Autonomy features include 3D-LiDAR-based collision avoidance and mission waypoint validation for autonomous navigation. Embedded software development includes modular architecture design and implementation in C++. Lastly, system integration includes sensor/actuator integration, testing, and characterization for functionality in harsh climate and terrain. <br/><img src='/images/UGV2.jpg'>"
