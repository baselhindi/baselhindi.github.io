Welcome to my homepage! My name is Basel Hindi, and I am pursuing a Master’s degree in computer science at Columbia University (expected graduation in December 2023). My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and human-computer interaction, and the usage of these tools for improving accessibility.

I graduated in 2018 with a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&M University. I then worked in industry for three years doing autonomous vehicle R&D. Throughout my time in industry, I developed a passion for CS, and more specifically, for computer vision and artificial intelligence. 

Research
======
Since starting at Columbia University, I have been conducting research within the domains of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Accessibility. I also joined the [Distributed Research Apprenticeships for Master's (DREAM) program](dreamprogram.html), in which I have had the pleasure of working with the [Computer-Enabled Abilities Laboratory (CEAL)](https://ceal.cs.columbia.edu).
